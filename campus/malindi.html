            St. Patrick’s Preparatory School is where the journey begins. As the
            heart of the St. Patrick’s Hill Schools, it has nurtured young minds
            for over 20 years—built firmly on Christian values, discipline, and
            a commitment to excellence. Our dedicated teachers support each
            child as they take their first steps in learning, equipping them
            with essential skills, confidence, and curiosity that will carry
            them through to high school and beyond. With small classes averaging
            15 pupils, we provide personalized attention in a nurturing
            environment where children are encouraged to think independently and
            grow boldly. Life at the Preparatory School goes beyond academics.
            Our vibrant extracurricular program—including sports, music, and
            drama—promotes creativity, teamwork, and a balanced lifestyle. Faith
            is central to our identity. Weekly chapel services and pastoral care
            help pupils grow spiritually as part of a caring Christian
            community. Come and see how we build confident learners and
            compassionate leaders from the very start.
